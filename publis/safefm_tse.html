<h2> Abstract </h2>

<p> This paper reports on a formal analysis experiment involving an
avionics control system. We describe a method for specifying and
verifying real-time systems with <a
href="http://www.csl.sri.com/pvs.html"> PVS </a>. The experiment
involves the formalization of the functional and safety requirements
as well as its multilevel verification. First level verification
demonstrates the consistency of thespecifications whilst the second
level shows that certain safety properties are satisfied by the
specifications. We critically analyze methodological issues of large
scale verification and propose some practical ways of structuring
verification activities for optimizing the benefits. </p>

<p> The work described in this paper was a major part of the <a
href="http://www.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk/research/formal/safefm.html">SafeFM</a>
project. </p>
