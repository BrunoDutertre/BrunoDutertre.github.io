    <h1>CNF Benchmarks from SMT-LIB QF_BV</h1>
    
    <hr>
    <p>
    The <a href="CNFs.zip">zip file</a> below contains 15447 SAT
    problems in DIMACS that were produced by <em>bit-blasting</em> the
    <a href="https://clc-gitlab.cs.uiowa.edu:2443/SMT-LIB-benchmarks/QF_BV.git">
      QF_BV</a> benchmarks of SMT-LIB.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are 41696 QF_BV problems in SMT-LIB. We converted them to CNF
      using <a href="https://yices.csl.sri.com">Yices 2</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yices 2 solves 18940 problems by preprocessing and
      simplification. We converted the rest (22756 problems) to CNF.
      Out of these CNF problems, we removed trivial benchmarks and duplicates.
      There were
      <ul class="square">
	<li>325 empty formulas (trivially SAT)</li>
	<li>2695 formulas that contain the empty clause (trivially UNSAT)</li>
	<li>4286 duplicates.</li>
      </ul>
      This leaves 15450 CNF files. Three of them are very large (more
      than 5GB). This <a href="CNFs.zip">zip file</a> contains the
      remaining CNF files, compressed with xz. The file is approximately 7GB.
